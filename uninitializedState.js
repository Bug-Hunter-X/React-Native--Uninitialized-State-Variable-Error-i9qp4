This error occurs when you try to access a state variable or a prop before it has been initialized. This is common in React Native applications where asynchronous operations may delay the initialization of data. For example, if you're fetching data from an API, the state variable that will hold the data might not be initialized yet when the component renders for the first time. In this scenario, attempting to access the data before it's available would lead to this error.
